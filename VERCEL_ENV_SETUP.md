## üö® DO THIS NOW - APP WON'T WORK WITHOUT IT!

Your app just deployed but it can't connect to Supabase yet. Follow these exact steps:

---

## Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard

1. Open: **https://vercel.com**
2. Find your **RecruitBridge** project
3. Click on it

---

## Step 2: Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

1. Click **Settings** tab (top of page)
2. Click **Environment Variables** in left sidebar

---

## Step 3: Add These THREE Variables

Click **"Add New"** for each of these:

### Variable 1:
```
Name: VITE_SUPABASE_URL
Value: https://frabthrbowszsqsjykmy.supabase.co
Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all 3)
```
Click **Save**

```
Click **Save**

## Step 4: Redeploy

1. Go back to **Deployments** tab
2. Find the latest deployment
3. Click the **...** menu (3 dots)
4. Click **Redeploy**
5. Confirm redeploy

**OR** just push any change to GitHub and it will auto-deploy.

---

## ‚úÖ Done!

After redeployment (takes ~2 minutes):

1. Visit **https://www.recruitbridge.app**
2. You should see the landing page
3. Click **"Start Free"** or **"Get Started"**
4. You'll see "Redirecting to sign in..."
5. Google OAuth screen should appear!

---

## üîß If It Still Doesn't Work

### Issue: "Missing Supabase credentials" error
- **Check**: Make sure all 3 env vars are added to Vercel
- **Check**: Make sure you redeployed after adding them
- **Check**: Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

### Issue: Google OAuth not configured
- **This is expected!** Follow `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` to set up Google sign-in
- Until Google OAuth is configured, you'll get a Supabase error when clicking "Start Free"
- But the flow is working correctly!
