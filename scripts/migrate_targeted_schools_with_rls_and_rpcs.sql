-- Migration: Add server-side enforcement for target schools
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/frabthrbowszsqsjykmy/sql/new
--
-- This migration:
-- 1. Ensures targeted_schools table has proper structure
-- 2. Adds RLS policies for user isolation
-- 3. Creates RPCs with server-side limit enforcement (3 for free, 7 for starter, 15 for core, unlimited for unlimited)

-- ============================================
-- STEP 1: Ensure table structure
-- ============================================

-- If table doesn't exist or needs columns, this will handle it
-- (assuming targeted_schools already exists based on code inspection)

-- Add user_id column if missing (links to auth.users for RLS)
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'targeted_schools' AND column_name = 'user_id'
  ) THEN
    ALTER TABLE targeted_schools ADD COLUMN user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

    -- Backfill user_id from athlete_id if possible
    -- Assumes athletes table has user_id or created_by that maps to users
    UPDATE targeted_schools ts
    SET user_id = a.user_id
    FROM athletes a
    WHERE ts.athlete_id = a.id AND ts.user_id IS NULL;
  END IF;
END $$;

-- Ensure created_at exists
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'targeted_schools' AND column_name = 'created_at'
  ) THEN
    ALTER TABLE targeted_schools ADD COLUMN created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now();
  END IF;
END $$;

-- Add composite unique constraint if missing
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_constraint
    WHERE conname = 'targeted_schools_user_school_unique'
  ) THEN
    ALTER TABLE targeted_schools
    ADD CONSTRAINT targeted_schools_user_school_unique
    UNIQUE (user_id, school_id);
  END IF;
END $$;

-- ============================================
-- STEP 2: Enable RLS and create policies
-- ============================================

ALTER TABLE targeted_schools ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies if any (clean slate)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read own targeted schools" ON targeted_schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own targeted schools" ON targeted_schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own targeted schools" ON targeted_schools;

-- Policy 1: Users can SELECT their own targeted schools
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own targeted schools"
  ON targeted_schools
  FOR SELECT
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Policy 2: Users can INSERT their own targeted schools
-- Note: actual limit enforcement happens in RPC, this just ensures user_id matches
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own targeted schools"
  ON targeted_schools
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Policy 3: Users can DELETE their own targeted schools
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own targeted schools"
  ON targeted_schools
  FOR DELETE
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- ============================================
-- STEP 3: Create server-side RPC functions
