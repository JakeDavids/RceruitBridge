## What YOU Need to Do

### 1. Add Testimonial Images

**Location:** `/Users/davidskids/Projects/RecruitBridge/src/pages/Landing.jsx`

Currently using placeholder initials (AM and CI). To add real images:

1. Copy your images to `/Users/davidskids/Projects/RecruitBridge/src/assets/`:
   - `renderedImage.jpeg` (Aiden Martinez photo)
   - `IMG_6180.JPG` (Caleb Irving photo)

2. Update the testimonial code (lines 363-393 in Landing.jsx):

Replace:
```jsx
<div className="w-14 h-14 bg-blue-600 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold text-xl">
  AM
</div>
```

With:
```jsx
<img
  src="/src/assets/renderedImage.jpeg"
  alt="Aiden Martinez"
  className="w-14 h-14 rounded-full object-cover border-2 border-blue-600"
/>
```

And replace the second testimonial's placeholder with:
```jsx
<img
  src="/src/assets/IMG_6180.JPG"
  alt="Caleb Irving"
  className="w-14 h-14 rounded-full object-cover border-2 border-yellow-600"
/>
```

### 2. Create Backend Cancellation Function

**In Base44 Cloud Functions**, create a new function at `/functions/subscription/cancel`:

```javascript
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method !== 'POST') {
    return res.status(405).json({ error: 'Method not allowed' });
  }

  const { userId, reason, reasonText, currentPlan } = req.body;

  // Log cancellation to database or send email to admin
  await sendEmail({
    to: 'realrecruitbridge@gmail.com',
    subject: `Subscription Cancellation - User ${userId}`,
    body: `
      User ID: ${userId}
      Current Plan: ${currentPlan}
      Reason: ${reason}
      Additional Comments: ${reasonText || 'None'}

      Please process refund within 24-48 hours.
    `
  });

  // Optional: Log to database for analytics
  // await CancellationLog.create({ userId, reason, reasonText, cancelledAt: new Date() });

  return res.status(200).json({ ok: true, message: 'Cancellation submitted' });
}
```
