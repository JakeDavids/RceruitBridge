## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX

### Issue #1: Images Not Loading in Landing Page

**Problem:** The testimonial images have hardcoded paths `/src/assets/...` which won't work in production.

**EXACT FIX:**

1. **First, add your images to the assets folder:**
   ```bash
   # Copy your images (do this in Terminal or Finder)
   cp ~/Downloads/renderedImage.jpeg ~/Projects/RecruitBridge/src/assets/aiden-martinez.jpg
   cp ~/Downloads/IMG_6180.JPG ~/Projects/RecruitBridge/src/assets/caleb-irving.jpg
   ```

2. **Then, I'll update the Landing.jsx to use proper imports:**

The images need to be imported at the top of the file and used as variables, not hardcoded paths.

**Current (WRONG):**
```jsx
<img src="/src/assets/renderedImage.jpeg" alt="Aiden Martinez" />
```

**Should be (CORRECT):**
```jsx
import aidenPhoto from '@/assets/aiden-martinez.jpg'
import calebPhoto from '@/assets/caleb-irving.jpg'

// Then in the component:
<img src={aidenPhoto} alt="Aiden Martinez" />
```

### Issue #2: Remove Base44 Landing Page (`index.jsx`)

**Problem:** Base44 auto-maps `src/pages/index.jsx` to the root path `/`, so when users visit app.recruitbridge.net, they see the OLD landing page instead of going directly to Dashboard.

**Why app.recruitbridge.net still loads even without domain registration:**
- Your Base44 app is deployed at a default Base44 URL
- When you configured Vercel to point app.recruitbridge.net to your app, Vercel proxies requests to your Base44 app
- So app.recruitbridge.net works because Vercel redirects it to your Base44 deployment

**SOLUTION: We need to RENAME or DELETE `index.jsx` and make Dashboard the default page after login.**

**Option A: DELETE the old landing page (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
rm /Users/davidskids/Projects/RecruitBridge/src/pages/index.jsx
```

**Option B: RENAME it so Base44 doesn't auto-map it**
```bash
mv /Users/davidskids/Projects/RecruitBridge/src/pages/index.jsx /Users/davidskids/Projects/RecruitBridge/src/pages/OldLanding.jsx
```

**Then update Layout.jsx to redirect `/` to Dashboard when user is authenticated:**

Find this section (around line 230-237):
```jsx
// ‚úÖ Public routes (no sidebar, no auth required)
if (PUBLIC_PATHS.has(path)) {
  return <>{children}</>;
}

// üö´ Protected routes - redirect to root if not authenticated
if (!user) {
  return <Navigate to="/" replace />;
}
```

Change it to:
```jsx
// ‚úÖ Public routes (no sidebar, no auth required)
if (PUBLIC_PATHS.has(path)) {
  return <>{children}</>;
}

// üö´ Protected routes - redirect to landing if not authenticated
if (!user) {
  return <Navigate to="/" replace />;
}

// ‚úÖ Redirect root to Dashboard for authenticated users
if (user && path === "/") {
  return <Navigate to={createPageUrl("Dashboard")} replace />;
}
```

## üìã STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Step 1: Fix Image Paths (DO THIS FIRST!)

Run these commands in Terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/davidskids/Projects/RecruitBridge

# Create assets folder if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p src/assets

# Copy your images (UPDATE THESE PATHS to where your actual images are)
# Replace ~/Downloads/... with the actual location of your images
cp ~/Downloads/renderedImage.jpeg src/assets/aiden-martinez.jpg
cp ~/Downloads/IMG_6180.JPG src/assets/caleb-irving.jpg
```

Then **WAIT** - I'll update the Landing.jsx file for you in the next step.

---

### Step 2: Remove Old Landing Page

```bash
# Delete the old Base44 landing page
rm /Users/davidskids/Projects/RecruitBridge/src/pages/index.jsx
```

---

### Step 3: Update PUBLIC_PATHS in Layout.jsx

The Layout.jsx currently has `"/"` in PUBLIC_PATHS, which means it allows unauthenticated access. We need to remove that AFTER deleting index.jsx.

**Find line 49-54 in `/src/pages/Layout.jsx`:**
```jsx
const PUBLIC_PATHS = new Set([
  "/",          // root landing page
  "/login",
  "/signup",
  "/pricing"
]);
```

**Change to:**
```jsx
const PUBLIC_PATHS = new Set([
  "/login",
  "/signup",
  "/pricing"
]);
```

**Then find line 230-237 and add the redirect:**
```jsx
// ‚úÖ Public routes (no sidebar, no auth required)
if (PUBLIC_PATHS.has(path)) {
  return <>{children}</>;
}

// üö´ Protected routes - redirect to landing if not authenticated
if (!user) {
  // If not on a public path, redirect to Google login
  window.location.href = 'https://app.recruitbridge.net/login';
  return null;
}

// ‚úÖ Redirect root to Dashboard for authenticated users
if (user && path === "/") {
  return <Navigate to={createPageUrl("Dashboard")} replace />;
}
```

### Step 4: Commit & Push Changes

```bash
cd /Users/davidskids/Projects/RecruitBridge

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Deploy: Fix landing page images, remove old landing, update routing"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

---

### Step 5: Deploy to Vercel

#### For Landing Page (recruitbridge.net):

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your **LANDING PAGE** project (the one with `VITE_APP_MODE=landing`)
3. Click **Deployments** tab
4. Click the **"..."** menu on the latest deployment
5. Click **"Redeploy"**
6. Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
7. Visit https://recruitbridge.net to verify

#### For Main App (app.recruitbridge.net):

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your **MAIN APP** project (the one with `VITE_APP_MODE=app`)
3. Click **Deployments** tab
4. Click the **"..."** menu on the latest deployment
5. Click **"Redeploy"**
6. Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
7. Visit https://app.recruitbridge.net to verify

**Expected behavior after deployment:**
- ‚úÖ https://recruitbridge.net ‚Üí Shows landing page with all statistics
- ‚úÖ Click "Get Started" ‚Üí Redirects to https://app.recruitbridge.net
- ‚úÖ https://app.recruitbridge.net ‚Üí Shows Google OAuth login
- ‚úÖ After login ‚Üí Shows Dashboard (NOT old landing page)

## ‚ùì TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Images not showing on landing page"
**Cause:** Images not copied to assets folder OR import paths wrong
**Fix:**
1. Verify images are in `/src/assets/` folder
2. Check browser console for 404 errors
3. Make sure Landing.jsx has proper imports (I'll fix this for you)

### "Still seeing old landing page at app.recruitbridge.net"
**Cause:** index.jsx still exists OR Vercel cache
**Fix:**
1. Verify index.jsx was deleted
2. Clear Vercel cache: Go to project settings ‚Üí Clear Cache ‚Üí Redeploy
3. Hard refresh browser: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

### "White screen after login"
**Cause:** Missing Dashboard page OR routing issue
**Fix:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Dashboard.jsx exists in src/pages/
3. Check Network tab for failed API calls

### "Domain not working"
**Cause:** DNS not configured properly
**Fix:**
1. Go to your domain registrar (GoDaddy)
2. Verify these DNS records:
   - `recruitbridge.net` ‚Üí Points to Vercel
   - `app.recruitbridge.net` ‚Üí Points to Vercel
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
4. Test with: `nslookup recruitbridge.net`
